### Post 1: Launch Announcement
```
🐝 Just shipped Swarm - turn your homelab into an AI supercomputer

Pool your Mac, Pi, and old laptops together. Run LLMs that won't fit on one device.

✅ Zero config (mDNS auto-discovery)
✅ Plug & play setup
✅ Works on Mac/Linux/RPi

Open source, MIT license

```

### Post 2: Problem/Solution
```
You: Have 28GB RAM across 3 devices 💻📱🖥️
Also you: Can't run llama-13b (needs 26GB)

Swarm: "Hold my distributed layers"

Pools devices → partitions model → runs inference

From 0 to AI cluster in 2 minutes.

```

### Post 3: Technical Deep Dive
```
How Swarm works:

1️⃣ mDNS discovery (nodes find each other)
2️⃣ Memory-based partitioning (intelligent layer distribution)
3️⃣ Coordinator routes inference
4️⃣ Async tensor transfer

Built with Python + Rich for beautiful terminal UI

Check out the demos 👇

```

### Post 4: Use Case
```
Real homelab setup:

• MacBook Pro M1: 16GB
• Raspberry Pi 5: 8GB  
• Old Mac Mini: 4GB

Combined: 28GB cluster

Can run: llama-13b, mistral-7b, llama-70b (4-bit)
Setup time: < 2 minutes
Cloud costs: $0

### Post 5: Call for Contributors
```
Swarm is open source and looking for contributors! 🐝

Next up:
• Real PyTorch/MLX model loading

### Professional Announcement
```
Excited to announce Swarm 🐝 - an open-source distributed AI inference framework!

The challenge: Modern LLMs require 20-100GB+ RAM, but most people have multiple consumer devices with 4-16GB each.

The solution: Pool resources across devices with zero-config setup.

Key innovations:
✓ mDNS-based auto-discovery
✓ Memory-proportional layer partitioning  
✓ Async coordination architecture
✓ Cross-platform (Mac/Linux/Raspberry Pi)

Built from scratch in Python. Alpha stage but functional.

Perfect for researchers, educators, and anyone exploring distributed systems.

MIT licensed. Contributions welcome.

🐝 Turn unused hardware into an AI cluster

Got old devices collecting dust? Pool them for distributed AI inference.

Swarm makes it stupid simple:
→ Install on each device
→ Nodes auto-discover
→ Run LLMs that won't fit on one machine

Zero config. Plug & play. Open source.

Built for homelabbers, hackers, and tinkerers.

Subject: Introducing Swarm 🐝 - Distributed AI for Your Homelab

Hey [Name],

Just shipped something I think you'll like: Swarm - distributed AI inference for consumer hardware.

**The problem:** You have a Mac (16GB), a Pi (4GB), maybe an old laptop. Individually, none can run modern LLMs. Together? They have 20-40GB.

**The solution:** Swarm pools them automatically. Zero config, plug & play.

Setup on each device:
```
git clone swarm
pip install -e .
swarm node
```

That's it. Nodes find each other, partition the model, coordinate inference.

Alpha stage, but functional. Built from scratch, open source, MIT license.

Check it out: https://github.com/neilyneilynig/swarm

Would love your feedback!

Neil

## Product Hunt Launch Copy

**Tagline:**  
"Turn your homelab into an AI supercomputer - distributed LLM inference with zero config"

**Description:**  
Pool computing resources across multiple consumer devices (Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi) to run large language models. Auto-discovery via mDNS, automatic layer partitioning, CLI and Python API. Open source, MIT licensed.

**What problem does it solve?**  
Modern LLMs need 20-100GB+ RAM, but most people have multiple devices with 4-16GB each sitting idle. Swarm pools them into a cluster so you can run models that won't fit on any single device.

**How is it different?**  
Zero configuration required. No manual IP/port setup. No cloud costs. Works with hardware you already own. Built for homelabbers and hackers.

**Maker Comment:**  
"Built this because I had a Mac, Pi, and old laptop gathering dust. Each alone couldn't run llama-13b, but together they could. Wanted something that 'just works' - type one command, nodes find each other. Alpha but functional. Real model loading coming soon!"
